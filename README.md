### **Author's notes**

- I started the project with a clean project, despite the course instructor's warning against this learning method due to more the possibility of more errors along the way
- My workflow consisted of disecting the provided design, building the ReactJS logic, and cross-checking HTML/CSS code.
- Difficulty lied more on the mastery of syntax and HTML/CSS nesting.
